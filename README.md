# Objective

To set up an SSR page that will in time connect to a headless CMS. For now, express will act as the CMS, creating some endpoints that will return some objects to mock as the CMS

## Project setup

You need to start the express server, as well as run NUXT

### On the root level

```
npm install
```

#### Run the server

This will start the server on `localhost:3005`

```
npm run server
```

### For the SSR Pages

CD into `/SSR` and install the packages.

```
npm install
```

#### Run the developer server

This will start the server on `localhost:3000`

```
npm run dev
```
